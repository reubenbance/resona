            <p>Too many fundraisers and prospect researchers know the challenge of scanning through hundreds or thousands of donor records, trying to identify who's ready for moving into the major gift pipeline. Traditional methods rely heavily on wealth screening and fundraiser intuition, but what if this could be supplemented with a more systematic, data-driven approach?</p>

            <p>At Resona, I've developed robust predictive modelling solutions for charities and campaigns of all sizes, from grassroots organisations to national institutions. Here's a bit of info about what I've learned about using machine learning to identify major donor prospects, and why this approach is becoming essential for modern fundraising teams.</p>

            <h2>The problem with traditional approaches</h2>

            <p>Most organisations identify major donor prospects using one of two methods:</p>

            <p><strong>Wealth screening</strong> tells you who could give, but not who will give. A too-common sight is the donor with significant capacity who remains at a £50 annual level, while committed supporters with more modest means stretch to make transformational gifts.</p>

            <p><strong>Fundraiser intuition</strong> is valuable but doesn't scale. Your team knows the small pool of donors they interact with regularly, but what about the other several hundred/thousand in your database? Pattern recognition is where humans excel locally but computational models excel globally.</p>

            <p>The most effective approach combines both: predictive models surface hidden patterns in your donor data, while fundraisers apply their expertise to convert those insights into productive relationships.</p>

            <h2>What predictive modelling actually predicts</h2>

            <p>When I build a major donor model for a client, I typically predict three distinct outcomes:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Major gift likelihood:</strong> What's the probability this donor will make a gift above your major gift threshold in the next 1-2 years?</li>
                <li><strong>Predicted gift size:</strong> If they do give, how much are they likely to contribute? This helps prioritise limited fundraiser time towards the highest-value prospects.</li>
                <li><strong>Retention probability:</strong> How likely is this donor to give again? This matters because cultivating a lapsed major donor is often more efficient than acquiring a new one.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Each prediction serves a unique strategic purpose, and combined, they create a comprehensive view of your donor pipeline.</p>

            <h2>Technical architecture</h2>

            <p>Building an effective predictive model requires careful attention to feature engineering, model selection, and validation (don't worry, you don't have to know what any of this means; that's my job).</p>

            <h3>Feature engineering - getting a model to think like a fundraiser</h3>

            <p>Raw data is essentially useless in telling us a coherent story about a donor. Someone who gave £100 five years ago isn't the same as one who gave £100 last month. I engineer features that capture these nuances:</p>

            <p>Beyond the basic RFM model (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values), I calculate gift velocity (i.e. are donations increasing?), consistency patterns, and seasonal giving behaviours. Engagement signals, like event attendance, email opens, survey responses, and volunteer activity all indicate affinity. I've found that engagement often predicts giving better than capacity alone. Wealth screening data is valuable, but it's often incomplete. I create composite capacity scores that handle missing data intelligently, using features like postcode indices, giving history, and other publicly available information. Lifecycle context - career stage, donor tenure, life events - all matter. The art lies in creating features that are both predictive and interpretable. Black boxes that work but can't be explained are pretty useless for getting buy-in.</p>

            <h3>Handling imbalanced data</h3>

            <p>Major donors typically represent 2-5% of most databases. This class imbalance poses technical challenges: a model that simply predicts "not a major donor" for everyone achieves 95%+ accuracy but zero usefulness.</p>

            <p>I address this through techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling), class weighting, and careful validation using precision-recall curves rather than raw accuracy. The goal isn't to maximise overall accuracy but to identify that crucial 5% as reliably as possible.</p>

            <h3>Model selection and validation</h3>

            <p>For most charity applications, I favour ensemble methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting. These approaches:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Handle non-linear relationships naturally (the relationship between giving history and future gifts is rarely linear)</li>
                <li>Provide feature importance scores that help fundraisers understand why someone scored highly</li>
                <li>Perform well even with modest dataset sizes (many charities have 5,000-50,000 donor records, not millions)</li>
                <li>Resist overfitting when properly tuned</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I validate models using time-based splits: train on historical data, predict forward in time, then measure what actually happened. This mimics real-world usage and prevents data leakage.</p>

            <h2>The incomplete data challenge</h2>

            <p>One question I hear repeatedly: "Our wealth screening only covers about a third of donors. Can modelling still work?"</p>

            <p>Absolutely. In fact, this is where machine learning excels. Rather than treating missing wealth data as a limitation, I treat it as a feature itself. A donor with no wealth screening data but strong giving history and high engagement often scores better than a wealthy individual with minimal connection to your cause.</p>

            <p>I use multiple imputation strategies:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Median/mode filling for missing values</li>
                <li>Creating "has_wealth_data" flags to capture systematic missingness</li>
                <li>Building models that learn to predict even without complete information</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The key insight: your historical data contains hundreds of other signals beyond wealth screening. Modelling helps you leverage all of them simultaneously.</p>

            <h2>Making predictions actionable</h2>

            <p>A model that generates accurate predictions but doesn't change behaviour has zero value. I design my outputs for maximum usability:</p>

            <p><strong>Segmentation frameworks:</strong> Rather than just probability scores, I create segments like "High Priority - Major Gift Prospect" or "At Risk - Retention Campaign Required." These translate directly to action plans.</p>

            <p><strong>Integrated scoring:</strong> Predictions flow into your CRM, appearing alongside existing donor records. Fundraisers don't need to log into separate systems or export spreadsheets.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation layers:</strong> For high-scoring prospects, I show why they scored highly. "High engagement score, increasing gift trajectory, recent wealthy postcode data" tells a story that fundraisers can act on.</p>

            <p><strong>Decile analysis:</strong> I rank-order your entire database and show performance by decile. The top 10% should contain 40-60% of your future major donors. If not, something's wrong.</p>

            <h2>What good looks like</h2>

            <p>When I implement predictive modelling with clients, I typically see:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>2-3x improvement in prospect identification efficiency:</strong> Fundraisers spend more time with donors likely to convert, less time on cold outreach</li>
                <li><strong>20-30% increase in major gift conversion rates:</strong> Better targeting means better conversations at the right time</li>
                <li><strong>Discovered opportunities:</strong> Often 15-25% of top-scoring prospects were completely off the fundraising team's radar</li>
                <li><strong>Retention improvements:</strong> Identifying at-risk major donors early allows for proactive stewardship</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>

            <p><strong>Over-reliance on capacity:</strong> The wealthiest people aren't always the most generous. Balance capacity signals with affinity and engagement data.</p>

            <p><strong>Ignoring model drift:</strong> Donor behaviour changes. Retrain your models at least annually, more often if you're in a rapidly changing environment.</p>

            <p><strong>Treating scores as gospel:</strong> Models are tools for prioritisation, not crystal balls. A low-scoring donor who explicitly expresses interest deserves attention regardless of their score.</p>

            <p><strong>Insufficient training data:</strong> You need at least several hundred positive examples (actual major gifts) to train reliable models. If you're a small organisation, consider starting with simpler propensity scoring (I can help with this too).</p>

            <p><strong>Poor data hygiene:</strong> Rubbish in, rubbish out. Before building models, ensure your data is clean, deduplicated, and consistently formatted (I can help with this too).</p>

            <h2>Humans still matter!</h2>

            <p>The most successful implementations I've seen combine machine precision with human judgment. Predictive models augment, rather than replace, fundraisers.</p>

            <p>Models surface patterns at scale. They flag the donor who's been quietly increasing their monthly gift for three years, or the lapsed supporter whose engagement has suddenly spiked. They catch signals humans might miss.</p>

            <p>But fundraisers bring context, relationship history, and intuition that no model can replicate. They know that a donor's recent family bereavement might temporarily reduce their capacity, or that someone just retired and might now have time to get more involved.</p>

            <p>The magic happens at the intersection.</p>

            <h2>Getting started: practical steps</h2>

            <p>If you're considering predictive modelling for your organisation:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Audit your data:</strong> What do you actually have? Donation history, engagement data, wealth screening, demographics? The more signal, the better, but you can start with just giving history and dates.</li>
                <li><strong>Define success clearly:</strong> What's your major gift threshold? What time horizon matters? Being specific about what you're predicting improves model performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Start simple:</strong> A well-designed RFM model often outperforms a poorly implemented neural network. Build complexity as you gain confidence.</li>
                <li><strong>Involve your fundraisers early:</strong> Their domain expertise is invaluable for feature engineering and validation. If they don't trust the model, they won't use it.</li>
                <li><strong>Measure and iterate:</strong> Track which high-scoring prospects convert. Use this feedback to refine your models over time.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Looking forward</h2>

            <p>Predictive modelling in the charity sector is still maturing. I'm seeing exciting developments in:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-time scoring:</strong> Models that update continuously as new engagement data arrives</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-channel attribution:</strong> Understanding how different touchpoints combine to influence giving</li>
                <li><strong>Planned giving prediction:</strong> Identifying supporters likely to include you in their will</li>
                <li><strong>Peer influence modelling:</strong> How social networks affect giving behaviour</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The fundamental truth remains: your donor database contains patterns that can dramatically improve fundraising effectiveness. The question isn't whether predictive modelling works, but how to implement it in a way that fits your organisation's culture, capacity, and goals.</p>

            <h2 style="border-bottom: none; margin-top: 60px;">Ready to transform your Donor Strategy?</h2>

            <p>At Resona, I specialise in making advanced analytics accessible to charities of all sizes. My approach emphasises transparency (you should understand why models make their predictions), practicality (models must integrate seamlessly into existing workflows), and partnership (I train your team to interpret and act on insights, not just deliver black-box scores).</p>

            <p>I believe that every organisation, regardless of size, deserves access to the data science techniques that major organisations have used for years. The tools have become more accessible. The techniques are well-established. What's often missing is expertise in applying them to the unique challenges of charity fundraising.</p>

            <p>If you'd like to discuss how predictive modelling could work for your organisation, I'd love to hear from you. Whether you're just starting to think about data-driven fundraising or you're ready to implement a comprehensive solution, I'm here to help you unlock the patterns hidden in your donor data and turn them into meaningful relationships and transformational gifts.</p>
